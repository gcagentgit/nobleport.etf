/**
 * Dashboard API surface.

 * Today every read goes through the deterministic mock fixtures so panels
 * render without a live backend. To swap in the FastAPI gateway, set
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_API_BASE` and replace each `getX()` body with a
 * `fetch()` call — the consumers and panels do not need to change.
