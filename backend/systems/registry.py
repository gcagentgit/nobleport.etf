"""
NoblePort Systems Truth Registry

The operating map of every NoblePort system/module with its truth bucket,
evidence, and next verification gate. Two sources feed it:

  1. MEASURED — the 14 repo projects, bridged from the program-completion
     engine. Code-complete on disk earns STAGED (built ≠ live), with the
     measured deliverable counts attached as evidence.
  2. DECLARED — external systems known only from claims or demo artifacts
     (EpochX status file, avatar deployment summary, etc.), classified by what
     their own evidence actually supports.

Hard rule, enforced in code: a node may carry VERIFIED only with a named
verifier and verification evidence. ``register()`` raises otherwise — the
registry physically cannot contain a self-declared "live" system.
